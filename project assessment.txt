Project Assessment

Over quarantine during the pandemic I have been playing a lot of League of Legends, so I decided to make a 
project that would be useful for the game.  I realized an annoying part of the game was that I would often 
miss a queue because I got up and didn't click the 'accept match.'  After taking this class, I knew there 
would be a way to get around this.
Overall I had a lot of fun making this code that actually turned out quite well and works just as intended.
I think after this class I can say that python is my favorite language that I have learned so far, due to its 
versatility and ease of use.  This final project was probably my favorite of all of them only because we got to 
choose what projects to make, and I am also going to make use of this project in the future when I play League
of Legends.
